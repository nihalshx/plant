## 3.3 Module Description

The system architecture consists of four primary modules working in coordination to provide end-to-end disease detection functionality.

### Data Processing Module
This module handles dataset preparation and preprocessing operations:

```python
# Data augmentation pipeline
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.1),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.02),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

The module implements stratified data splitting (80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing) to maintain class distribution balance. Data augmentation techniques include geometric transformations (flips, rotations) and photometric adjustments (color jittering) to improve model generalization.

### Model Training Module
This module implements the EfficientNet-B0 architecture with transfer learning:

```python
# Model initialization with transfer learning
def create_model(num_classes=38):
    model = efficientnet_b0(weights=EfficientNet_B0_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
    in_features = model.classifier[1].in_features
    model.classifier[1] = nn.Linear(in_features, num_classes)
    return model
```

The training pipeline incorporates mixed precision training using automatic mixed precision (AMP) for computational efficiency, AdamW optimizer with weight decay for regularization, and early stopping with patience mechanism to prevent overfitting.

### Inference Engine Module
This module handles real-time prediction and Grad-CAM visualization:

```python
# Grad-CAM implementation
def generate_gradcam(model, image_tensor, target_class):
    model.eval()
    # Forward and backward hooks for gradient extraction
    gradients = []
    activations = []
    
    def backward_hook(module, grad_input, grad_output):
        gradients.append(grad_output[0])
    
    def forward_hook(module, input, output):
        activations.append(output)
    
    # Register hooks and perform inference
    handle_b = model.features.register_backward_hook(backward_hook)
    handle_f = model.features.register_forward_hook(forward_hook)
    
    # Generate class activation map
    output = model(image_tensor)
    loss = output[:, target_class].sum()
    loss.backward()
    
    # Compute Grad-CAM heatmap
    gradients = gradients[0].cpu().data.numpy()[0]
    activations = activations[0].cpu().data.numpy()[0]
    weights = np.mean(gradients, axis=(1, 2))
    cam = np.zeros(activations.shape[1:], dtype=np.float32)
    
    for i, w in enumerate(weights):
        cam += w * activations[i]
    
    cam = np.maximum(cam, 0)
    cam = cv2.resize(cam, (224, 224))
    cam = cam / np.max(cam) if np.max(cam) != 0 else cam
    
    return cam
```

### Web Application Module
The Flask application provides user interface for disease detection:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            flash('No file selected')
            return redirect(request.url)
        
        file = request.files['file']
        if file.filename == '':
            flash('No file selected')
            return redirect(request.url)
        
        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
            file.save(filepath)
            return redirect(url_for('predict', filename=filename))
    
    return render_template('index.html')
```

## 3.4 Model Architecture

- Depth: d = α^φ (number of layers)
- Width: w = β^φ (number of channels)  
- Resolution: r = γ^φ (input image size)

Where α=1.2, β=1.1, γ=1.15, and φ determines scaling intensity.

**EfficientNet-B0 Configuration**:
- Input Resolution: 224×224×3
- Depth Coefficient: 1.0 (7 stages)
- Width Coefficient: 1.0 (baseline channels)
- Parameters: 5.3M (highly efficient)
- FLOPs: 0.39B (computational efficiency)

**Mobile Inverted Bottleneck (MBConv) Blocks**:
Each MBConv block contains:
1. Expansion convolution (1×1)
2. Depthwise separable convolution (3×3 or 5×5)
3. Squeeze-and-Excitation attention
4. Projection convolution (1×1)
5. Skip connection (when applicable)

## 3.5 Training Pipeline
